Wouldn't it be great if your PHPUnit tests would be automatically rerun whenever you change some code? This package can do exactly that.

With the package installed you can do this:

```bash
phpunit-watcher watch
```

This will run the tests and rerun them whenever a file in the `app`, `src` or `tests` directory is modified.

Want to pass some arguments to PHPUnit? No problem, just tack them on:

```bash
phpunit-watcher watch --filter=it_can_run_a_single_test
```

## Installation

You can install this package globally like this

```bash
composer global require spatie/phpunit-watcher
```

After that `phpunit-watcher watch` can be run in any directory on your system.

Alternatively you can install the package locally as a dev dependency in your project

```bash
composer require spatie/phpunit-watcher --dev
```

Locally installed you can run it with `vendor/bin/phpunit-watcher watch`


## Usage

All the examples assume you've installed the package globally. If you opted for the local installation prepend `vendor/bin/` everywhere where `phpunit-watcher` is mentioned.

You can start the watcher with:

```bash
phpunit-watcher watch
```

This will run the tests and rerun them whenever a file in the `src` or `tests` directory is modified.

You can customize the directories being watched by creating a file named `.phpunit-watcher.yml` in your project directory. Here's some example content:

```yaml
watch:
  directories:
    - src
    - tests
  fileMask: '*.php'
```

Want to pass some arguments to PHPUnit no problem, just tack them on:

```bash
phpunit-watcher watch --filter=it_can_run_a_single_test
```
