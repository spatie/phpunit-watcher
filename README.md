Wouldn't it be great if your PHPUnit tests would be automatically rerun whenever you change some code? This package can do exactly that.

With the package installed you can do this:

```bash
phpunit-watcher watch
```

Here's how it looks like:

This will run the tests and rerun them whenever a file in the `app`, `src` or `tests` directory is modified.

Want to pass some arguments to PHPUnit? No problem, just tack them on:

```bash
phpunit-watcher watch --filter=it_can_run_a_single_test
```

In his excellent talk at Laracon EU 2017 [Amo Chohan](https://github.com/amochohan) shows our phpunit-watcher in action.

## Installation

You can install this package globally like this

```bash
composer global require spatie/phpunit-watcher
```

After that `phpunit-watcher watch` can be run in any directory on your system.

Alternatively you can install the package locally as a dev dependency in your project

```bash
composer require spatie/phpunit-watcher --dev
```

Locally installed you can run it with `vendor/bin/phpunit-watcher watch`


## Usage

All the examples assume you've installed the package globally. If you opted for the local installation prepend `vendor/bin/` everywhere where `phpunit-watcher` is mentioned.

You can start the watcher with:

```bash
phpunit-watcher watch
```

This will run the tests and rerun them whenever a file in the `src` or `tests` directory is modified.

Want to pass some arguments to PHPUnit? No problem, just tack them on:

```bash
phpunit-watcher watch --filter=it_can_run_a_single_test
```

## Customization

Certain aspects of the behaviour of the tool can be modified. All options can be set in a `.phpunit-watcher.yml` in your project directory.

If a such a config file does not exist in the project directory, the tool will check if the file exists in any of the parent directories of the project directory.

Here's some example content. Read on for a more detailed explanation of all the options.

```yaml
watch:
  directories:
    - src
    - tests
  fileMask: '*.php'
notifications:
  passingTests: false
  failingTests: false
phpunit:
  arguments: '--stop-on-failure'
```

### Customize watched directories and files

You can customize the directories being watched by creating a file named `.phpunit-watcher.yml` in your project directory. Here's some example content:

```yaml
watch:
  directories:
    - src
    - tests
  fileMask: '*.php'
```

### Desktop notifications

By default the tool will display desktop notifications whenever the tests pass or fail. If you want to disable certain desktop notifications update `.phpunit-watcher.yml` by adding a `notifications` key.

```yaml
notifications:
  passingTests: false
  failingTests: false
```

### Initial PHPUnit arguments

If you want to use pass the same arguments to PHPUnit everytime to watcher starts, you can specificy those in the `.phpunit-watcher.yml` config file. Here's an example:

```yaml
phpunit:
  arguments: '--stop-on-failure'
```

When starting the tool with some arguments (eg `phpunit-watcher watch --filter=my_favourite_test`) those arguments will get used instead of the ones specified in the config file.
